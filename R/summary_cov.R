# 1) first add the type of covariates  in the output of the main function


# 2) summary.HMM needs to add betas under each gamma and emiss (if covariates are used ... : )



# 3) function outputs a predicted probability conditioned on certain value of covariates

# - include * when interval does not include zero
# - From_state, To_state, Beta, credibility intervals, and starts for summary statistics
# - depends on covariate type (dichotomous / continuous covariates)


# 4) use sim function to create simulated data
