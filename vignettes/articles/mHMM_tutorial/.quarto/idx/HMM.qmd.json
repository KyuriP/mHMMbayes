The HMM is a discrete time model: for each point in time $t$, we have one hidden state that generates one observed event for that time point $t$.\\\nHence, the probability of observing the current outcome $O_t$ is exclusively determined by the current latent state $S_t$:\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\nPr(O_{t} \\mid \\ O_{t-1}, O_{t-2}, \\ldots, O_{1}, \\ S_{t}, S_{t-1}, \\ldots, S_{1}) = Pr(O_{t} \\mid S_{t}).\n\\end{equation}\n```\nThe probability of observing $O_t$ given $S_t$ can have any distribution, e.g., discrete or continuous. In the current version of the package `mHMMbayes`, only the categorical emission distribution is implemented.\\\nThe hidden states in the sequence take values from a countable finite set of states $S_t = i, i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$, where $m$ denotes the number of distinct states, that form the Markov chain, with the Markov property:\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\nPr(S_{t+1} \\mid \\ S_{t}, S_{t-1}, \\ldots, S_{1}) = Pr(S_{t+1} \\mid S_{t}).\n\\end{equation}\n```\nThat is, the probability of switching to the next state $S_{t+1}$ depends only on the current state $S_t$. As the HMM is a discrete time model, the duration of a state is represented by the self-transition probabilities $\\gamma_{ii}$, where the probability of a certain time t spent in state $S$ is given by the geometric distribution: $\\gamma_{ii}^{t-1}(1-\\gamma_{ii})$.\\\nThe HMM includes three sets of parameters: the initial probabilities of the states $\\pi_i$, the matrix $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$ including the transition probabilities $\\gamma_{ij}$ between the states, and the state-dependent probability distribution of observing $O_t$ given $S_t$ with parameter set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i$. The initial probabilities $\\pi_i$ denote the probability that the first state in the hidden state sequence, $S_1$, is $i$:\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\pi_i = Pr(S_1 = i) \\quad \\text{with} \\sum_i \\pi_i = 1. \n\\end{equation}\n```\nOften, the initial probabilities of the states $\\pi_i$ are assumed to be the stationary distribution implied by the transition probability matrix $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$, that is, the long term steady-state probabilities obtained by $\\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbf{\\Gamma}^T$. The transition probability matrix $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$ with transition probabilities $\\gamma_{ij}$ denote the probability of switching from state $i$ at time $t$ to state $j$ at time $t+1$:\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma_{ij} = Pr(S_{t+1} = j \\mid S_{t} = i) \\quad \\text{with} \\sum_j \\gamma_{ij} = 1.\n\\end{equation}\n```\nThat is, the transition probabilities $\\gamma_{ij}$ in the HMM represent the probability to switch between hidden states rather than between observed acts, as in the MC and CTMC model. The state-dependent probability distribution denotes the probability of observing $O_t$ given $S_t$ with parameter set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i$. In case of the package, the state-dependent probability distribution is given by the categorical distribution, and the parameter set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i$ is the set of state-dependent probabilities of observing categorical outcomes. That is,\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\nPr(O_t = o \\mid S_t = i) \\sim \\text{Cat} (\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i),\n\\end{equation}\n```\nfor the observed outcomes $o = 1, 2, \\ldots, q$ and where $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i = (\\theta_{i1}, \\theta_{i2}, \\ldots, \\theta_{iq})$ is a vector of probabilities for each state $S = i, \\ldots, m$ with $\\sum \\theta_i = 1$, i.e., within each state, the probabilities of all possible outcomes sum up to 1.\\\nWe assume that all parameters in the HMM are independent of $t$, i.e., we assume a time-homogeneous model. In the vignette [Estimation of the multilevel hidden Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mHMMbayes/vignettes/estimation-mhmm.pdf) we discuss three methods (i.e., Maximum likelihood, Expectation Maximization or Baum-Welch algorithm, and Bayesian estimation) to estimate the parameters of an HMM. In the package `mHMMbayes`, we chose to use Bayesian estimation because of its flexibility, which we will require in the multilevel framework of the model.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","number-sections":true,"output-file":"HMM.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","bibliography":["bibliography.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
